# ***World Weather Analysis***

## ***Overview***
The purpose of this project is to build an app that can collect, analyze, and visualize weather data from across the globe. The PlanMyTrip app carries out all of these tasks and is a helpful tool in the travel industry. By using PlanMyTrip, clients can make plans to vacation and chose their destination based on local weather forcasting. 

## ***Retrieve Weather Data***
First, we will generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, retrieve the current weather description for each city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Then, we weill create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.
We will retrieve the following information from the API call:
- Latitude and longitude
- Maximum temperature
- Percent humidity
- Percent cloudiness
- Wind speed
- Weather description
